Hi, this is Weizhe Lin.
I have studied for 1 year at the University of Hong Kong after I graduated from high school, and transferred to University of Cambridge for a 4-year BA/MEng programme.
I was awarded Trinity Overseas Bursary and Cambridge Trust Scholarship for my undergraduate study at the Department of Engineering.
I have received my Bachelor of Art and Master of Engineering degree on 31 June, 2021.
And I will commence my PhD course at Cambridge in October this year.

This page is to list some of my projects and publications to help other researchers to know me better.

# Work Experience
### Intern Researcher at Microsoft Software Technology Center, Beijing (2021)
* Developing cutting-edge recommender systems for movie recommendation

### Remote Researcher at Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge (2020)
* Proposed a decentralized deep learning framework that utilizes Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to address multi-agent path planning problems.
* The model trained at simple problem instances show great generalizability in very complex and hard cases (100x in agent number and map size).

### Researcher at Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge (2019)
* Proposed a network-based novel multi-modal feature fusion framework which can be utilised to make prediction of psychological disorder
* Developed a self-adaptor(fidgeting) detection system and applied it to investigate automated detection of psychological distress

### Cloud Engineering Intern in Informetis Europe Ltd. (2018)
* Developed a Python Django-based website which tracks usage data by IoT devices in Power Supply monitors (which the company manufactures). This information then helps machine learning engineers to develop more accurate algorithm to predict how energy is used by various electrical appliances
* Gained skills in database management, involving the use of MySQL, Google Bigtable and Redis Caching.

### Mars Lander Design and Programming Contest: Received a prize from Airbus Defense and Space [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Mars-Lander)
I came up with some good solutions to many of the extension exercises, including the effects of planetary rotation and wind. My autopilot could handle injection into arbitrary orbits with pre-specified apogees and perigees. I also performed some preliminary investigations into optimal control, tweaking the autopilot to minimize peak acceleration or descent time, and to deal with moderate levels of engine lag and delay. I was then invited to tour around the Airbus Stevenage Base.

### EasyEye (HackCambridge2019) [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/EasyEye_HackCambridge_2019)
We implemented an eye monitoring system with OpenCV to detect the fatigue status (blinking frequency/squinting) of the users' eyes. The program on a laptop uses a built-in camera to track and analyze the users’ eyes. It uploads data onto online database and the data will be evaluated by the server. The server then creates alerts and sends the alerts to the Fitbit watch of the user, alerting the users of the fatigue of their eyes by vibration and sound.

### Robotics Society Computer Vision Subteam Task: RMRC Motion Detection [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/RMRC_MotionDetection)
* Using OpenCV and python, I developed a customized algorithm to detect motion of several black objects moving on a white board and count the number. Currently, the algorithm compromises the results of hue detection and frame difference detection to generate a reasonable output.

### Arm Hackathon Machine Learning Project: Wearable Mbed [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Arm_Hackathon_Wearable_Mbed)
Our Mbed board works as a wearable device, which collects the acceleration data of the user and applies machine learning model to tell which state the user is currently in (idle, walking, running, typing on laptop...). The collected data can be recorded and be used to provide an overview of the user's daily activity. The user can understand the daily pattern of a day and notice how his/her daily pattern is being changed. For example, the less and less sleeping time will warm them to adjust their habits at night.

### WIFI Guard [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/WIFIGuard)
+ Patent Number: 2016SR049201 (CHINA)
+ An android application which monitors the data usage and therefore prevents background data traffic abuse
+ 3rd in Computer Science (category) of the 15th Awards Program for Future Scientists (National)

### Virus Protection Assistant [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Photon_Protector)

+ A completed anti-virus software which is able to catch the virus based on “behavior analysis”
+ Gold Medal in 30th Fujian Adolescents Science Technology & Innovation Contest, China
