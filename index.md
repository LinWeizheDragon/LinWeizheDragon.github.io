Hi, this is Weizhe Lin.
After graduating from high school, I studied at the University of Hong Kong for one year before transferring to the University of Cambridge to pursue a four-year BA/MEng program.
During my undergraduate studies at the Department of Engineering, I was honored to receive the Trinity Overseas Bursary and the Cambridge Trust Scholarship.
On June 31, 2021, I successfully obtained both my Bachelor of Arts and Master of Engineering degrees.
On May 18, 2024, I received my Master of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge.
On Nov 30, 2024, I received my Ph.D. degree at the University of Cambridge; My research focuses on the intersection of vision and language.
In collaboration with Stranks Lab, University of Cambridge, I am also involved in vision technology that has the potential to advance material scientific research.

**Keywrods of my research experiences:** Multi-modal Retrieval, Question Answering, Diffusion Models, Dialogue Systems, Recommender Systems, Graph Neural Networks, and Multi-robot Path Planning.

This page is to list some of my projects and publications to help other researchers to know me better.

### Mars Lander Design and Programming Contest: Received a prize from Airbus Defense and Space [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Mars-Lander)
I came up with some good solutions to many of the extension exercises, including the effects of planetary rotation and wind. My autopilot could handle injection into arbitrary orbits with pre-specified apogees and perigees. I also performed some preliminary investigations into optimal control, tweaking the autopilot to minimize peak acceleration or descent time, and to deal with moderate levels of engine lag and delay. I was then invited to tour around the Airbus Stevenage Base.

### EasyEye (HackCambridge2019) [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/EasyEye_HackCambridge_2019)
We implemented an eye monitoring system with OpenCV to detect the fatigue status (blinking frequency/squinting) of the users' eyes. The program on a laptop uses a built-in camera to track and analyze the users’ eyes. It uploads data onto online database and the data will be evaluated by the server. The server then creates alerts and sends the alerts to the Fitbit watch of the user, alerting the users of the fatigue of their eyes by vibration and sound.

### Robotics Society Computer Vision Subteam Task: RMRC Motion Detection [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/RMRC_MotionDetection)
* Using OpenCV and python, I developed a customized algorithm to detect motion of several black objects moving on a white board and count the number. Currently, the algorithm compromises the results of hue detection and frame difference detection to generate a reasonable output.

### Arm Hackathon Machine Learning Project: Wearable Mbed [Code](https://github.com/LinWeizheDragon/Arm_Hackathon_Wearable_Mbed)
Our Mbed board works as a wearable device, which collects the acceleration data of the user and applies machine learning model to tell which state the user is currently in (idle, walking, running, typing on laptop...). The collected data can be recorded and be used to provide an overview of the user's daily activity. The user can understand the daily pattern of a day and notice how his/her daily pattern is being changed. For example, the less and less sleeping time will warm them to adjust their habits at night.
