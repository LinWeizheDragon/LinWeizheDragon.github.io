excerpt: 'Online forums and social media platforms provide noisy but valuable data every day. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network-based user embedding system, Author2Vec. The model incorporates sentence representations generated by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with a novel unsupervised pre-training objective, authorship classification, to produce better user embedding that encodes useful user-intrinsic properties. This user embedding system was pre-trained on post data of 10k Reddit users and was analyzed and evaluated on two user classification benchmarks: depression detection and personality classification, in which the model proved to outperform traditional count-based and prediction-based methods. We substantiate that Author2Vec successfully encoded useful user attributes and the generated user embedding performs well in downstream classification tasks without further finetuning.'

Online forums and social media platforms provide noisy but valuable data every day. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural network-based user embedding system, Author2Vec. The model incorporates sentence representations generated by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with a novel unsupervised pre-training objective, authorship classification, to produce better user embedding that encodes useful user-intrinsic properties. This user embedding system was pre-trained on post data of 10k Reddit users and was analyzed and evaluated on two user classification benchmarks: depression detection and personality classification, in which the model proved to outperform traditional count-based and prediction-based methods. We substantiate that Author2Vec successfully encoded useful user attributes and the generated user embedding performs well in downstream classification tasks without further finetuning.
